# [STL]String Reduction

# String Reduction

# Description
<p>Lisa loves playing string reduction games: <br />
Given three strings s1, s2 and s3, one needs to replace all substring s2 in the string s1 with s3 repeatedly, until no s3 in found in the resulting string.</p>

# Input
<p>The first line is an integer t, indicating the number of test cases.<br />
Then follow t lines. The i-th line contains three strings s1, s2 and s3. Each string consisting of only lowercase letters, with no spaces between letters. Each string will contain no more than 300 letters.</p>

# Output
<p>For each test case, print the final string in a single line.</p>

# Sample_Input
```

abc ab a

```

# Sample_Ouput
